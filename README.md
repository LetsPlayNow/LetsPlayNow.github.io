A site about me

# Some todos
* He loads part of assets from 'assets' folder.
And other part from 'src' folder.
Doesn't seems nice.
We need to move it to one folder
Oh ssems like src folder is not included in build

* Delete strange unnecessary files

* GITHUB api doesn't limits me in 60 request per hour.
It's so low! I can't show my credits in json file to resize request limit.
So I just use link to github.

* We can use Mind Map to show my skills

* Lasts:
1) Thigs above that.
2) Cool cv
3) customize main page
4) Load to github
5) Write good article about AI Project
